  utter_cpr_steps:
  - text: "Step 1: start by laying down the victim on a hard surface and kneel next to them.\n\n
  Step 2: place your hands one on top of the other, in the middle of their chest, between their two breasts, with your arms straight and then press with all the weight of your body.\n\n
  Step 3: apply strong pressure, pushing your hands 5 to 6 cm into the chest and raising them between each pressure.\n\n
  Step 4: perform the pressures at a steady pace (100 pressures per minute), counting to 30. After every 30 pressures, stop to give mouth-to-mouth only if you know how to do so.\n\n
  Step 5: continue until the defibrillator tells you to stop or until the emergency services arrive.\n\n"

  utter_how_to_mouth_to_mouth:
  - text: "A quick warning: mouth-to-mouth should only be performed when knowing the technic.\n\n
  Step 1: tilt the victim's head back, lift their chin, put one hand on their forehead and pinch their nostrils between your thumb and index.\n\n
  Step 2: with your other hand, hold their chin so that their mouth stays opened.\n\n
  Step 3: inhale normally, lean towards the victim and cover their mouth completely with yours.\n\n
  Step 4: breath in slowly and regularly air in their mouth while checking that their chest rise up.\n\n
  Step 5: keep the victim's head and chin in position and rise little bit to check that their chest lowers during the expiration.\n\n
  Repeat these steps a second time and then resume CPR."

  utter_what_is_defibrillator:
  - text: "A defibrillator is a device that vocally guides you to restart the stopped heart of a cardiac arrest victim. 
  It can be automated hence simplifying its use."

      payload: "/how_to_defibrillator"

  utter_how_to_defibrillator:
  - text: "Turn on the defibrillator and read the instructions while someone else performs CPR.\n\n
  Start by placing the electrodes on the skin of the victim and check that no one is touching them while the defibrillator analyses their heart rate.\n\n
  If an electric shock must be delivered, ensure that everyone is standing far from the victim and its immediate environment.\n\n
  Press the button if required, and it will deliver the electric shock by itself.\n\n
  If the defibrillator asks you, perform CPR by series of 30 compression and two breaths if you know how to perform mouth-to-mouth.\n\n
  Continue to follow the defibrillator's instruction until the victim regains normal breathing or the emergency services arrive.\n\n
  If the victim's breathing goes back to normal and she wakes up, stop doing CPR BUT don't turn off the defibrillator and keep the electrodes on the victim.\n\n
  If the victims stay unsconcious after regaining normal breathing, put them in lateral position of safety and wait for the emergency services."

  utter_pros_cpr:
  - text: "Performing CPR greatly increase the chances of survival of the victim and reduce the potential after-effects.\n\n
  The first irreversible brain damages appear after 5 minutes without oxygen, hence the importance of starting the CPR as soon as possible."
